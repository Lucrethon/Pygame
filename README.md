Title: 2D Combat Arena with Pygame (Hollow Knight-Inspired)

Status: Work in Progress

A 2D combat arena game developed in Python using the Pygame library. This project is inspired by the aesthetics and combat mechanics of Hollow Knight.
The main goal is to survive in an endless arena against waves of enemies that progressively increase in difficulty.

All pixel art assets (characters, enemies, backgrounds) were created 100% by me from scratch using Aseprite.

Key Features:

Implementation of the player's basic moveset (movement, jump, attack).

Enemy spawning system with scalable difficulty.


Technologies Used:

Python, Pygame, Aseprite (for all artwork)
