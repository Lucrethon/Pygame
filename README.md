Title: 2D Combat Arena with Pygame (Hollow Knight-Inspired)

Status: Work in Progress

A 2D combat arena platformer built with Python and Pygame-ce. Inspired by *Hollow Knight*, this project features fluid movement and combat mechanics, including slashing attacks, pogo-jumping, and directional recoil. Players fight through waves of ground and flying enemies (Crawlid and Gruzzer) with increasing difficulty. The game includes a complete state management system (Menu, Pause, Victory, Game Over), visual health UI with damage animations, and hit-stop effects for impactful combat.

All pixel art assets (characters, enemies, backgrounds) were created 100% by me from scratch using Aseprite.

Key Features:

Implementation of the player's basic moveset (movement, jump, attack, pogo).

Enemy spawning system with scalable difficulty (Phases and Waves).

Precise collision detection using custom hitboxes for combat and environment interaction.



Technologies Used:

Python, Pygame-ce, Aseprite (for all artwork)
